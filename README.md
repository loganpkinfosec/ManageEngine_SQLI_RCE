This repository provides two Python-based proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits targeting a critical unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the AMUserResourcesSyncServlet endpoint of ManageEngine Applications Manager (versions 11.0 to <14.0). The backend database for this application is PostgreSQL, which allows the attacker to craft and load a User-Defined Function (UDF) written in C to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the underlying Windows host.
